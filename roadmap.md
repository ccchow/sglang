# Revised MeZO Zeroth Order Training Integration Roadmap

**Final Status**: ✅ Implementation complete with all core features working. See [mezo-final-findings.md](mezo-final-findings.md) for comprehensive results and analysis.

This revised roadmap builds on the original document, incorporating insights from the analysis of MeZO's fixed two-way perturbation characteristic. Specifically, the design now emphasizes leveraging the symmetry of the two perturbations (positive and negative along a fixed direction \( z \)) to optimize KV cache reuse (e.g., through shared prefixes and approximations) and enable efficient in-memory weight updates (e.g., scalar-scaled vector operations). This enhances performance in forward-only training, particularly for LoRA fine-tuning, while aligning with SGLang's inference optimizations like RadixAttention.

The revision also elaborates on detailed development tasks (broken into sub-steps) and adds a new section for Validation Tasks, including unit/integration tests, benchmarks, and convergence checks. Given that SGLang's real 2025 H1 roadmap (as of July 10, 2025) includes RL training integrations but no direct MeZO support, this plan positions MeZO as a complementary lightweight training extension, potentially synergizing with RL features.

## 1. Overview

The primary goal remains to leverage SGLang's high-performance inference engine to accelerate the forward passes required by the MeZO algorithm. This enables efficient, forward-only LoRA fine-tuning of large language models directly within the SGLang ecosystem, combining SGLang's inference speed with MeZO's memory-efficient training. 

Key enhancements in this revision:
- Exploit MeZO's fixed two-way perturbation (symmetric \( +\epsilon z \) and \( -\epsilon z \) along a fixed \( z \)) for KV cache optimizations (e.g., shared prefix caching) and streamlined weight updates (e.g., in-place scalar adjustments).
- Support for quantized models (e.g., 4-bit via bitsandbytes) to ensure compatibility with memory-constrained hardware.
- Alignment with potential RL integrations in SGLang's 2025 roadmap for hybrid workflows.

## 2. Core Design

The integration is designed as a first-class feature within SGLang, avoiding network overhead by performing all operations in memory.

-   **Public API**: A new user-facing function, `sglang.mezo_finetune`, will serve as the main entry point for users to initiate MeZO training. It now includes optional parameters for perturbation hyperparameters (e.g., \( \epsilon \), RNG seed for \( z \)) and KV cache strategies.
-   **Core Component**: A new `MeZOTrainer` class, located in `python/sglang/srt/mezo_trainer.py`, encapsulates the entire training process.
-   **In-Memory Workflow**:
    1.  The `mezo_finetune` function initializes the SGLang `ModelRunner` and `LoRAManager`.
    2.  A new, trainable `LoRAAdapter` is created specifically for the training session. Its weights (`θ`) are the target of the optimization.
    3.  The `MeZOTrainer` executes the main training loop as described in MeZO's Algorithm 1, now optimized for fixed two-way perturbations.
    4.  Each training step samples a fixed \( z \), performs two forward passes using perturbed weights (`θ + ϵz` and `θ - ϵz`) to get the losses `ℓ+` and `ℓ-`. Leverage symmetry for KV cache reuse (e.g., compute shared prefixes once and approximate divergences).
    5.  These forward passes are executed by SGLang's `ModelRunner`, leveraging its existing, highly optimized infrastructure (e.g., `ForwardBatch`, attention backends, RadixAttention for prefix sharing).
    6.  The gradient is estimated from the loss difference, and the LoRA weights are updated directly in memory via scalar-scaled vector addition (exploiting the fixed \( z \) for efficiency).

## 3. Initial Implementation Summary

The foundational work for this feature has been completed, with revisions incorporating perturbation optimizations.

-   **File Created**: `python/sglang/srt/mezo_trainer.py`
-   **Current Status**:
    -   The `MeZOTrainer` class and the public `mezo_finetune` function have been created.
    -   The core MeZO step logic (perturb -> forward -> estimate gradient -> update) is implemented, now with symmetry-based KV cache approximations in `_forward_pass`.
    -   The `_forward_pass` method successfully interfaces with the SGLang runtime by constructing the necessary `Req` and `ScheduleBatch` objects, including batching for the two symmetric perturbations.
    -   The initialization logic for the `ModelRunner`, `LoRAManager`, and a new `LoRAAdapter` is in place, making the feature runnable in a basic configuration. Added support for quantization configs.
