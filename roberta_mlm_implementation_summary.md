# RoBERTa Masked Language Model Implementation in SGLang

## Summary

I've successfully implemented RoBERTa for Masked Language Modeling (MLM) in SGLang by adding the `XLMRobertaForMaskedLM` class to `/python/sglang/srt/models/roberta.py`.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **RobertaLMHead Class**
- Implements the language modeling head for masked token prediction
- Architecture:
  - Dense layer (hidden_size → hidden_size)
  - GELU activation
  - Layer normalization
  - Decoder layer (hidden_size → vocab_size)
  - Shared bias parameter

### 2. **XLMRobertaForMaskedLM Class**
- Full model combining RoBERTa encoder with MLM head
- Features:
  - Forward pass returns prediction scores for all tokens
  - Optional loss computation when labels are provided
  - `compute_mlm_logits()` method for extracting logits at specific mask positions
  - Proper weight loading with support for HuggingFace checkpoint compatibility

### 3. **Key Features**
- Compatible with SGLang's model infrastructure
- Supports tensor parallelism (when properly initialized)
- Can work with RadixAttention optimization (requires ModelRunner setup)
- Handles both full sequence MLM and position-specific MLM (e.g., for SST-2 with template)

## Usage Example

```python
from sglang.srt.models.roberta import XLMRobertaForMaskedLM
from transformers import RobertaConfig

# Create config
config = RobertaConfig.from_pretrained("roberta-base")

# Initialize model (requires tensor parallel initialization)
model = XLMRobertaForMaskedLM(config=config)

# Use for MLM predictions
output = model(input_ids, positions, forward_batch)
```

## Integration with MeZO

The MLM implementation enables:
1. **Continuous gradients**: Unlike accuracy objective, MLM provides continuous loss gradients
2. **RadixAttention optimization**: Can leverage KV cache reuse between +εz and -εz passes
3. **SST-2 with MLM trick**: Use template "It was [MASK]." with label words for classification

## Why RadixAttention was "Simulated"

The initial tests simulated RadixAttention because:
1. **Model mismatch**: Used HuggingFace models directly instead of SGLang's infrastructure
2. **Missing initialization**: Tensor parallel groups weren't initialized
3. **No ModelRunner**: Didn't use SGLang's request batching system

With this implementation, real RadixAttention can now be used when:
- Using `ModelRunner` with proper initialization
- Setting up tensor parallel groups
- Using SGLang's request batching infrastructure

## Limitations

1. Requires proper SGLang server setup for full functionality
2. RadixAttention benefits are limited for MLM compared to autoregressive models
3. Tensor parallel initialization required for standalone usage

## Next Steps

To use with full RadixAttention optimization:
1. Initialize SGLang server with RoBERTa MLM model
2. Use `ModelRunner` with proper LoRA configuration
3. Implement custom `ForwardBatch` handling for MLM-specific features
